In order to execute the R script you have to:
* Create a subdirectory called Calderon with the files "la dama duende.txt", "la vida es sueño.txt" and "el principe constante.txt".
* Create a subdirectory called Lorca with the files "bodas de sangre.txt", "romancero gitano.txt", "yerma.txt" and "Nueva York.txt".
* Inside of Calderon directory you have to create a directory for each document too called, Principe,Dama and Sueño. Inside of the there should be the related document.
* Inside of Lorca directory you have to create a directory for each document. The names of the directories are  Bodas, Romancero, Yerma and York.

Once you have create the directories you have to be in the home directory of the proyect and execute de R notebook in Rstudio or other R IDE.

The names of the files could not be the same but it doesn't matter. For example "la dama duende.txt" could be "La Dama Duende.txt" because the program doesn't use the names of the files, but the name of the directories.
At the end you should have the files twice .One in the author directory and another in the play directory.
